            <p>The name comes form the Greek word "aletheia" which means disclosure or truth. We live in a global culture where
                much of what we purchase with our hard earned money is often times valued by how much we're willing to pay.
                This arbitrarily assigned value is called Phantom Value. So what does that have to do with guitars? A lot!
                I hate to use Parker Guitars as an example, because Ken Parker is such a great guy and a personal hero of
                mine. For me, he's up there with Les Paul, Leo Fender, and Ned Steinberger as far as guitar design innovators
                are concerned. But since Parker guitars are no longer made in the US, and Ken is no longer part of it, let's
                talk Phantom Value in Parker Guitars. The best way to illustrate this is by comparing two specific models.
                The Fly Deluxe, and the Fly Artist are identical guitars except that the Deluxe uses a poplar body and is
                painted while the Artist uses Spruce and has a clear coat. That's it! Everything else is the same. The Deluxe
                and The artist share the same body shape and hardware. There are small cosmetic differences. The sperzel
                tuners on the Artist are black as opposed to the satin chrome ones on the Deluxe. Yet the Artist's price
                tag is about $2,000 more than the Deluxe! 2000 dollars is a lot of money to pay for a few pounds of spruce.
                Maybe if the Artist was made from the timbers of Columbus' ship Santa Maria that would make sense. But it's
                not, it's phantom value. To add to the confusion, there is a growing movement of luthiers and guitar players
                who don't believe that wood has anything to do with a solid body guitar's sound. Acoustic guitars are different,
                but to them, a solid body's sound comes entirely from the pickups, and not the wood. To them, there's no
                such thing as tonewoods for electric solid bodies. Personally I believe that wood does affect the overall
                sound of a solid body. I've been a player for more than 35 years and I do hear it. The way I see it, everything
                solid has a resonant frequency, and sound bouncing around a medium with a resonant frequency will get colored
                somehow. But the reality is that the sound from the wood needs to bounce back to the strings loudly enough
                to be heard by the pickups to make an impact. It's there. But what I think is happening is that it's so subtle
                some people simply can't hear it, even some professionals. Some manufacturers would like you to believe the
                prettier the wood, or the more exotic, the prettier the sound. One thing’s for sure, the prettier the wood,
                the prettier the guitar, and the more expensive. Exotic wood just means a species closer to extinction, and
                more expensive. It doesn’t necessarily mean a better tone. A quilted maple top doesn’t sound any better than
                a non figured maple top. The later being more acoustically desirable in some applications. Tone woods do
                have their sounds though. I love the sound of mahogany, it's pretty, not too expensive, readily available,
                and has a nice warmth to it. But people don’t realize that the wood used to make all those lovely vintage
                guitars (Swietenia Mahagoni) is gone! Even the stuff they replaced it with (Swietenia Macrophylla) has been
                commercially extinct since 2003. All commercially available mahogany now is traded as "true" mahogany. But
                it's not the stuff we traditionally used. The "true" is a marketing label used to boost buyers confidence
                in the product. In other words, we haven't had real mahogany for years! So really no one should be a tonewood
                snob, and be all high and mighty about purity and tradition. Because unless you have a stash of really old
                mahogany, the stuff you’re using is a different species altogether. Honduras, and African Mahogany used on
                high end, expensive guitars are actually alternatives to the alternative. They are the next best choices
                because they approximate the sound of real mahogany. The truth is, every piece of wood will sound different
                from batch to batch, within the same species, or within the same tree. The wood may even sound different
                across the length of the piece. That’s because wood was once alive, and many factors affect its growth and
                therefore its grain. So what do you do when wood is naturally inconsistent, and tonewoods are slowly becoming
                extinct. You use Flaxwood. The Alethean "Prota" uses Flaxwood for its neck, and hollow body. Flaxwood is
                made from natural recycled Spruce fibers, mixed with a modern polymer that behaves much like wood. Spruce
                is an excellent tonewood used on pianos, guitars, and violins. The Spruce and polymer binding process makes
                Flaxwood very predictable and homogeneous. It also allows sound to propagate more consistently across the
                fretboard. Sound travels in the direction of the wood grain. Flaxwood doesn't have a unidirectional grain
                like natural wood does, so the sound travels more like ripples in a pond, outwardly. This characteristic
                of Flaxwood makes the guitar more balanced and responsive to play. There are no "dead" notes, or notes that
                ring more than others across the fretboard. And what's more, the Alethean "Prota" is semi-acoustic, so the
                material does affect the guitar's sound, whether you're a Tonewood believer or not. Being a composite material
                Flaxwood is impervious to changes in the weather. This is especially great for travelling musicians. It also
                means your instrument stays in tune better, and for longer. It has one more advantage over traditional wood.
                Besides it being made of recycled wood, the finished material itself is recyclable! You can melt it down
                to reuse. I don’t know many people who’d melt down their favorite axes but nevertheless this makes for a
                very eco-friendly building material. Once you’ve cut a few pieces of wood to build a guitar neck or body,
                most of the wood that lands on the floor is waste. Not so with a Flaxwood guitar, since all waste can be
                melted down and reused. -Al
